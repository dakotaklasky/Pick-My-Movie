# Pick My Movie

## Introduction

This Python CLI application is for people who spend just as much time thinking about what movie to watch as they do watching the movie. Pick My Movie will generate a movie or TV show for you to watch and enjoy completely at random or with some select preferences in mind. After watching a movie feel free to log your movie to keep track of your favorites! Want to rewatch something you really liked? You can see a list of all of your logged movie ratings at any time.
